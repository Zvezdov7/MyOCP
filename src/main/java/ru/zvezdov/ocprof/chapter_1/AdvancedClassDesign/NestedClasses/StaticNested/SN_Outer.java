 *
 *         A static nested class is a static
 *         class defined at the member level. It can be instantiated without an object of the
 *         enclosing class, so it canâ€™t access the instance variables without an explicit object of
 *         the enclosing class.
 *
 *         In other words, it is like a regular class except for the following:
 *         The nesting creates a namespace because the enclosing class name must be used to refer
 *         to it.
 *         It can be made private or use one of the other access modifiers to encapsulate it.
 *         The enclosing class can refer to the fields and methods of the static nested class.
 *
 *         ONLY STATIC INNER CLASS CAN DECLARE STATIC METHODS
